# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Objective
Predicting delivery times to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, using data analysis and machine learning.

## Overview
Predicting food delivery times is super important for services like GrubHub, Zomato, GrubHub, and Uber Eats to maintain transparency and improve customer satisfaction. Here's how machine learning aids in accurate prediction:

- **Understanding the Challenge**: Delivery time prediction involves estimating the time it will take for an order to reach the customer from the restaurant.
  
- **Key Strategy**: A pivotal factor is the distance between the pickup and delivery points. Historical data on delivery times for similar distances is instrumental.

- **Features**:
  1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on past deliveries, focusing on the distance covered and the time taken.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the data to uncover and understand hidden data patterns.
  3. **Feature Engineering**: Examine how delivery time correlates mainly with distance and other such factors, and create more features from existing data to improve prediction ability.
  4. **Algorithm Selection**: Employ machine learning algorithms to model these relationships.
  5. **Performance Evaluation**: Tweak parameters for these models and choose which model correctly interprets and predicts the relationship.
  6. **Real-Time Prediction**: Use the model to predict delivery times for new orders in real-time, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

- **Data Requirement**: Access to a comprehensive dataset is essential, encompassing details like delivery distances and times.

This systematic approach leverages machine learning to provide dynamic and accurate delivery time predictions, fostering trust and efficiency in food delivery services.
